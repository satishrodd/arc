This repository is the implementation of prefix tree.
To run the program, after checkout, simply execute the
"run.sh" file.

The repository consists of following files,

1) defs.h: 
Header file, which contains all the function declarations, and
Macro definitions, used in the prefix tree implementation.

2) prefix_tree.c:
The main implemetation of prefix tree is in this file.

3) main.c:
Beginning of the sample test program, which uses the prefix tree implemented.

4) run.sh:
Simple script to build and execute the sample test program.
It also generates the binary file "bin"

5) pyscript.py
python script used for basic unit testing.

6) testcases
Description of all the TCs covered in pyscripts.py

Scope for improvements:
----------------------
1) Path compression : Current implemetation does not optimize the prefix
creation. For ex: 127.0.0.1/32, if this is the first prefix for the tree,
it will create 32 nodes. This can be optimized, and require more design
and code effort.

2) Thread safe: Current functionality is not thread safe, i.e. if one
thread calls for node delete, and another thread calls for sub-tree walk, 
there is a chance that, the program may crash, because, the node might
have been deleted by thread 1 but might have been in use by thread 2.
The implementation can be made thread safe by introducing the locking
machanism per.
